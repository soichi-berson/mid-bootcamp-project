# EXCEL: Analyzing UK Tourism

## Introduction
This project involved the analysis of UK Tourism data from 2018 to 2022, with a focus on gaining practical experience with Excel, including PivotTables and creating dashboards. The original analysis was conducted using Tableau for the mid-bootcamp project ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/soichi-berson/mid-bootcamp-project)), and this project replicates the analysis using Excel.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze trends in UK tourism over the past five years.
- Identify the countries with the largest number of visitors.
- Determine the regions contributing the most to UK tourism.
- Discover any notable differences or trends.
- Examine the trends of EU countries.

## Data Sources
- Data from 'Office for National Statistics' ([ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/)): Number of visitors, average spending per day, and average length of stay.
- Data from the World Bank ([World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/)): GDP, population, income group, and region.
- Data from Wikipedia ([Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)): Information on EU membership, English language usage, and Commonwealth membership.
